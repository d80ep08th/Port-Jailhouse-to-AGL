# Port-Jailhouse-to-AGL
-----------------------
If we use AGL as the main OS to install a hypervisor on an AGL reference platform. We can then partition the CPU using that hypervisor. This hypervisor will give the RTOS a virtual operating platform. This is where the Jailhouse hypervisor becomes a core part of the project.The RTOS running as guest on the hypervisor can then procure data in real time and communicate it with the AGL OS.
